**** DOKUMENTATION ****


I realised that during the creation of each map, where i wanted an element of "locked objects" to work,
I implemented different "stages" of the boss fight - now in hindsight, i see that i could just have had one file file and one method
to do it, as I based my logic on a fall through and a level lock system... passing the variable around allowed me to just have one check.

It's to late now to implement this work, so ill leave it as it is for now

For next time, i'd keep all bosses in the same class instead of breaking it out, the same thing goes for
my "Maps"

- as i want every level to have it's own unqiue boss -> this method that i went with might be the best working way for that, connected to my current knowledge.
